Lotus Notes Data Exporter

Select the appropriate Lotus Script according to wanted export output type.

Read the "_info.txt" file for the selected Lotus Script and check for version compability and parameter settings.

The Lotus Script code exports a single Lotus Notes database completely using XML, TXT, DXL or other export formats, including all or parameter-selected notes-documents and attached files inside each notes document. 

You must have access to Lotus Notes Client with Designer Client in order to create a Lotus Script agent running this code. Lotus Notes ID in use must have sufficient access (Access Control List, preferably Manager).
